Max right (a skin for ignited emulator)
This is an ignited skin that I made for personal use. It only works on ignited due to the quick settings menu and the alternative skin

I made it for my iphone 14 pro max. I set the mapping size to 430X932 because that is the viewport of 14 pro max, but it might show up wonky on other devices. Additionally, the icons on the side may conflict with the notch for other devices. Because 14 pro max has dynamic island, there is more space on the sides and it doesn't cover up the buttons.

I only posted this skin because since I made it for my self, I shared it incase anyone wants to use or edit it or whatever for their own use, so dont expect any updates.

I named this skin max right because it is for 14 pro max, and the notch should be on the right side of the screen and the phone should be in landscape mode. Because the background is black on my screen, the dynamic island notch blends in. This is what it looks like on my playthrough:
